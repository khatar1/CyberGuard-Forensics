# 🛡️ CyberGuard: Automated Web Forensic & Phishing Intelligence

**CyberGuard** is a professional-grade, open-source forensic tool designed for automated URL analysis. It combines network reconnaissance, source code signature detection, and visual evidence capture to identify phishing threats and server-side vulnerabilities.



## 🌟 Key Features

- **Advanced Forensic Engine:** Built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for high scalability and modularity.
- **Anti-Cloaking Detection:** Automatically identifies "Cloaking" tactics where malicious servers serve different content to security bots vs. real users.
- **Visual Evidence Capture:** Integrated live-snapshot API to document the target's interface at the time of analysis.
- **Network Reconnaissance:** Real-time port scanner to identify exposed services (FTP, SSH, DB) on the target host.
- **SSL Metadata Extraction:** Deep analysis of SSL certificate validity and issuer authority.
- **Signature-Based Detection:** Regex-powered engine to scan for phishing patterns and credential-harvesting indicators.
